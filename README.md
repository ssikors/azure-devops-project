# Azure CLI deploy script
This is a project that I made during my studies to learn how to deploy applications to Azure Cloud. It deploys an example application from GitHub.
To use it you need to download the Azure CLI, log in and run the deploy script. There are 3 possible deployment configurations, the first one deploys all components on the same VM, the others are more advanced.
